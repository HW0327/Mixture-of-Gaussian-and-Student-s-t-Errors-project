  The package requires users to fit a three-column data file into the models. The first column should be the time of each observation in ascending order, the second column is the magnitude of brightness, and the third column is the error for each observation. If your datafile contains additional columns, be sure to filter out these three columns before bringing them into the program. Here is an example of the datafile.
